## 1. Let's build a simple app together ðŸŽ‰

Create a simple app that introduces us to serverless apps. In this app, issue will be created in github whenever new ticket is created. This app will talk to github using webhook.
- Register with Github Webhook and get client_id and client_secret.
- Provide client_id and client_secret in oauth_config.json file.
- Use 'fdk run' to execute this app.
- Open your freshdesk ticket as shown in example url https://subdomain.freshdesk.com/helpdesk/tickets/1?dev=true.
- You can see ur app in right sidebar as we have given ticket_sidebar in manifest.json file.
- Provide Api key and github repository in this url http://localhost:10001/custom_configs and click install
- When we simulate onTicketCreate with sample payload issue is created in github as shown below,
- OnAppInstall registers a webhook with github by using a unique target URL generated by the app and we store in db also.
- When we call OnAppUnistall (i.e, when we unistall app) will fetch webhook URL from data storage and request GitHub to delete the webhook. So, github stops sending notifications to the app after it is uninstalled.
